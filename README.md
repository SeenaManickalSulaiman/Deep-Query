# Deep Query
This app empowers users to ask questions and receive answers from any uploaded fileâ€”including structured and unstructured documents like PDFs, DOCX, WhatsApp chats, and social media dataâ€”using Groqâ€™s fine-tuned large language models. Built on LangChainâ€™s retrieval-augmented generation, it ensures answers are strictly grounded in the uploaded documents, providing accurate, context-aware responses and transparently indicating when an answer isnâ€™t available. With fast vector search via FAISS and rich embeddings from Hugging Face, this app excels at transforming complex data into meaningful insightsâ€”all through an intuitive, secure, and reliable interface.
