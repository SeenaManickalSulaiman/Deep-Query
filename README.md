# Deep Query
### Overview
This project is a demonstration of how to build an AI-powered Document Q&A System using Groqâ€™s large language models (LLMs) integrated with LangChainâ€™s RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) framework. The app processes uploaded documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT, WhatsApp chats, and social media filesâ€”both structured and unstructured), enabling users to ask questions and receive accurate, context-aware answers directly from the content theyâ€™ve provided. The app ensures that answers are strictly grounded in the uploaded documents, and it transparently indicates when answers are not availableâ€”preventing hallucinations and maintaining reliability.

### Problem Statement

Traditional document Q&A systems face several challenges:
1. Poor Retrieval Quality: Incomplete or irrelevant passages can lead to incorrect or hallucinated answers.
2. Contextual Gaps: Answer generation often pulls unrelated information from outside the document, leading to misleading responses.
3. Lack of Trust: Users need confidence that answers are grounded in their own documents, especially for sensitive data like WhatsApp chats or social media content.

### Proposed Solution
This project introduces a robust, document-grounded Q&A system that:
* Parses a wide range of documentsâ€”including WhatsApp chats, social media exports, PDFs, DOCX, and TXT filesâ€”using reliable parsing libraries (PyMuPDF, python-docx, and text parsing).
* Utilizes LangChainâ€™s RAG architecture with FAISS and Hugging Face embeddings to retrieve the most relevant content chunks.
* Fine-tunes Groqâ€™s large language models on domain-specific tasks to enhance accuracy and relevance in answering questions from documents.
* Ensures that answers come strictly from uploaded documents, and if no relevant content is found, the system explicitly informs the user.
* Provides interactive analytics to monitor usage trends and query categories for continuous improvement.

### Features
** Document Versatility:**  Supports PDFs, DOCX, TXT, WhatsApp chats, and social media dataâ€”both structured and unstructured.
** Document-Grounded Answers: ** Answers are generated solely from uploaded documents, preventing hallucinations.
** Fine-Tuning Ready:**  Utilizes Groqâ€™s fine-tuned LLMs for domain-specific Q&A.
** Fast Vector Search:**  Uses Hugging Face embeddings and FAISS for efficient context retrieval.
** Interactive Analytics:**  Provides dashboards showing query categories and usage trends.
** User-Friendly Interface:**  Built with Streamlit for easy uploads, configuration, and interactive querying.
